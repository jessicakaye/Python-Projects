| [Reviews & Big Data Analytics](https://github.com/jessicakaye/Python-Projects/tree/master/Amazon/Reviews%20%26%20Big%20Data%20Analytics) | Text Processing, Latent Direchlet Allocation, Sentiment Analysis | Amazon review data within the "Clothing, Shoes, & Jewelry" category, as obtained from [Ni et al (2018) at UCSD](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) | LDA was conducted on the reviews for the top 10 most reviewed products within the category. The objective was to determine the dominant topics and words associated with each topic to infer what mattered the most to consumers for a specific product. Following this observation, sentiment analysis was conducted via SVM to analyze the change (in this case, lack thereof) in sentiment for a product based solely on reviews that contained the dominant topics.
